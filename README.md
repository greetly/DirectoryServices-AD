# DirectoryServices-AD

We developed a PowerShell script that allows you to send Greetly your Active Directory users via HTTPS. You can schedule this script to run as a job on your environment. All you have to do is update the variables in the script with your AD and Greetly information.

# NOTE

For non-servers this requires Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows. The required PowerShell plug-in can be downloaded from the following URLs:
